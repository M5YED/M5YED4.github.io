            <h3>Evolution Statement</h3>
            <p>“My name is Mikaeel and I am the founder and CEO of AssetFlow Automations. I started this company to create automations that would help asset/investment management firms. However, I came to realise that in doing so, I would be limiting this company from expanding and creating a huge range of systems. I decided that the best decision I could make is to become business-neautral, meaning we could create amazing automations for everyone; no matter the industry.<br><br>

I would like to say that I’m proud of my whole team, who fought for this company from the beginning and helped me to raise it to ranks that we could only have dreamt of. We have all learnt and evolved alongside this company and we promise to continue to do so for as long as possible. ”</p>
